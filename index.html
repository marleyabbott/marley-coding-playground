          <p>On the first night there is vomit.
            Before the vomit she talks at you in the language you have pretended to understand since the morning at the train station where they picked you up and tossed your bags into the back.  

The couch is made of wooden pellets, covered in thin foam. Foam bubbles up and coats your tongue. 

Before talk there is sugo and melone and formaggio sliced thinly and a bottle of homemade red wine. 

You decline. You retract. You are drunk. 

A woman working in the bar corrects your sentences. You repeat after her. Swirl the words around your mouth. Chew on them, swallow, 
but they come rising back up.  

Bile tainted with track changes. 

You sit on the wooden pellet couch that is covered in a red blanket. You try the acupuncture technique to stop nausea that the remedial massage therapist you used to date taught you. You press down on your right wrist with your left thumb.

She walks in mid-vomit and comforts you with words that feel-are familiar. 

Mid shower, the water runs out. You stand naked in front of the tiny sink rinsing shampoo from your dead ends. 

Outside the bathroom window, a soccer ball is tossed between small dirty soles.

          <p>The tank was not like the round water tank you see in your mind when your mother tells you they lived in a water tank. 

Now you know the tank was cut in half and turned on its side so that the side  of the old image becomes the real roof. 

At night in your proper bedroom with the slated roof and the insulated walls, the clothes on the back of your chair become a Strega with a hooked nose. She doesnâ€™t scare you. But her morning acts of disappearance do. 

As a child in the bedroom, you could imagine many places better to live than a water tank. The bedroom that could fit the water tank inside of it maybe, if you could visualise and then measure the parameters.  

You walk the parameters of the story , graze your hand on the corrugated iron edges.
